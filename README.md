# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

**Hint**: Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, you'll notice that you will need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, how could we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name?

You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Pseudo Code for HTML
* Header with title for weather dashboard.
* Left-hand side: search bar to search for a specific city along with a list of cities from the search history.
* Main body that consists of two sections:
    1) Top section includes the name of the city, the current date, and weather stats (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind) for the current day.
    2) Bottom section includes a five day weather forecast of said city.

## Pseudo Code for CSS
* Style for the header.
* Font styling for the title and the weather stats.
* Background color for the main body.
* Color for the search bar and the list of cities.
* Color for the five day weather forecast.

## Pseudo Code for JavaScript
* Create a function that will retrieve the weather stats for the current day.
    1) Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.
    2) Create a variable that will store the current date.
    3) Create a variable that will store the name of the city.
    4) Create a variable that will store the temperature.
    5) Create a variable that will store the precipitation.
    6) Create a variable that will store the humidity.
    7) Create a variable that will store the wind speed.
* Create a function that will retrieve the weather stats for the five day forecast.
* Create a function that will retrieve the weather stats for the search history.
* Create a function that will retrieve the weather stats for the search bar.
* Create a function that will retrieve the weather stats for the list of cities.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria: 

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%
